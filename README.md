## Installation

```bash

```

For GPU acceleration (highly recommended):

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riiswa/octax.git
cd octax
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Environment Usage

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from octax.environments import create_environment

# Create environment
env, metadata = create_environment("brix")
print(f"Playing: {metadata['title']}")

# Simple random policy
@jax.jit
def rollout(rng):
    state, obs, info = env.reset(rng)
    
    def step(carry, _):
        rng, state, obs = carry
        rng, action_rng = jax.random.split(rng)
        action = jax.random.randint(action_rng, (), 0, env.num_actions)
        
        next_state, next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(state, action)
        return (rng, next_state, next_obs), reward
    
    final_carry, rewards = jax.lax.scan(step, (rng, state, obs), length=1000)
    return jnp.sum(rewards)

# Run episode
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
total_reward = rollout(rng)
print(f"Total reward: {total_reward}")
```

### Vectorized Training (64 Parallel Environments)

```python
# Run 64 environments in parallel
@jax.jit
def vectorized_rollout(rng, num_envs=64):
    rngs = jax.random.split(rng, num_envs)
    return jax.vmap(rollout)(rngs)

rewards = vectorized_rollout(rng, 64)
print(f"Mean reward: {jnp.mean(rewards):.2f} ± {jnp.std(rewards):.2f}")
```

### Gymnax Integration

```python
from octax.environments import create_environment
from octax.wrappers import OctaxGymnaxWrapper

# Create Gymnax-compatible environment
env, metadata = create_environment("brix")
gymnax_env = OctaxGymnaxWrapper(env)
env_params = gymnax_env.default_params

# Use with any Gymnax-compatible algorithm
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
obs, state = gymnax_env.reset(rng, env_params)

for _ in range(100):
    rng, rng_action, rng_step = jax.random.split(rng, 3)
    action = gymnax_env.action_space(env_params).sample(rng_action)
    obs, state, reward, done, info = gymnax_env.step(
        rng_step, state, action, env_params
    )
```

**Observation Space**: The agent receives the raw CHIP-8 display as a `(frame_skip, 32, 64)` boolean array, where `frame_skip` (default: 4) provides temporal information. Each frame is a 32×64 monochrome image capturing the complete visual state—exactly what a human player would see.

**Action Space**: A discrete space where actions map to game-specific CHIP-8 keys. For example, Pong uses `[1, 4]` (up/down), Brix uses `[4, 6]` (left/right), and Tetris uses `[4, 5, 6, 7]` (rotate/move). An additional no-op action is always available. Games automatically configure their relevant action subsets, eliminating irrelevant keys from the action space.

## Performance

OCTAX achieves substantial speedups over traditional CPU-based environments through JAX vectorization:

<p align="center">   <img src="https://github.com/riiswa/octax/blob/main/imgs/figure3_performance.png?raw=true" alt="Performance Scaling" width="600"/>   <br>   <em>OCTAX vs EnvPool performance scaling across parallelization levels (RTX 3090)</em> </p>

**Key Results:**

- **14× faster** than EnvPool at 8192 parallel environments
- **350,000 steps/second** on a single RTX 3090
- **Near-linear scaling** up to GPU memory limits
- **Sub-second compilation** for fast iteration

This enables:

- **Comprehensive experiments**: Run 100+ hyperparameter configurations overnight
- **Statistical rigor**: Train with 50+ random seeds for reliable results
- **Rapid prototyping**: Iterate on algorithms with immediate feedback

## Training Results

PPO training across 16 diverse games (5M timesteps, 12 seeds each):

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Ways to contribute:

### Adding New Games

1. **Find a CHIP-8 ROM**: Many public domain games available

2. Analyze the game

   : Use our interactive emulator (

   ```
   main.py
   ```

   ) to identify:

   - Score registers (look for BCD operations marked with 🎯)
   - Termination conditions (game over states)
   - Required controls (which keys are used)

3. **Create environment file**: See `octax/environments/` for examples

4. **Test and submit**: Ensure score/termination work correctly

```python
# octax/environments/my_game.py
from octax import EmulatorState

rom_file = "my_game.ch8"

def score_fn(state: EmulatorState) -> float:
    return state.V[5]  # Score in register V5

def terminated_fn(state: EmulatorState) -> bool:
    return state.V[12] == 0  # Game over when V12 reaches 0

action_set = [4, 6]  # Left/Right controls
startup_instructions = 500  # Skip menu screens

metadata = {
    "title": "My Game",
    "description": "A classic arcade game",
    "release": "2024",
    "authors": ["Author Name"]
